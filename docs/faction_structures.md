1. Settlement
    1. A fixed, populated, self-sustaining (or striving to be self-sustaining) location that serves as a hub for a
       faction's operation and population.
    2. Populated: has a measurable population. Can grow/shrink, have different types/roles like colonists, workers,
       scientists, military, etc. Populations consume air, water, and food.
    3. Production hub: Capable of producting resources via extraction, refining, growth, manufacturing as well as
       units (vehicles, etc.)
    4. Buildings/Districts: Composed of multiple buildings or districts (e.g. Residential, Industrial, Agricultural,
       Research, Administrative, Military). The buildings dictate production capabilities, population capacity, and
       resource consumption
    5. Queues: Construction of new buildings, Construction of units
    6. Resource Management: Has local storage for various Resources. Can trade with other settlements and installations
       for resources.
    7. Tech level: can have its own tech level for buildings/districts.
    8. Security: Requires defense
    9. Influence/Control: Projects a sphere of influence on surrounding hexes/space, enabling extraction of resources.
    10. Location
        1. Surface (Hex): One settlement per hex. While a hex can be large, its the specific point of development.
        2. Orbit/asteroid belt: Large space stations that function as settlements, massive habitat rings, repurposed
           asteroids
    11. Evolution: Can grow over time by adding more buildings/districts.
2. Installation
    1. Definition: A fixed, specialized facility with minimal or no permanent civilian population, designed for a
       specific purpose, e.g. resource extraction, refining, military, communication, research
    2. Key Characteristics
        1. Minimal/No Population: Operated by a crew (can be considered an Agent or Unit) or fully automated. Consumes
           minimal resources, possibly only energy for automated.
        2. Specialized Production:
            1. Mine/Etractor: Primarily produces extracted resources (Ice, Minerals, Gases, Hydrocarbons, Organics)
            2. Refinery/Processor: Converts raw materials into intermediate resources
            3. Factory: Makes finished resources or Units
            4. Military Base: hosts units
            5. Communications Relay: Facilitates communications across the system
            6. Research: Conducts scientific research.
            7. Administrative/Other
        3. Limited Buildings: Fewer, highly specialized modules compared to a settlement.
        4. Resource Needs: consumes energy and whaterver is need to produce its output.
        5. Vulnerability: can be less resilient to attack.
    3. Locations
        1. Surface (hex) one installation per hex.
        2. Orbit/Asteroid Belt: space-based installations, e.g. automated mining stations, orbital defense platforms,
           etc.
    4. Evolution: can be upgraded/expanded. Also can be converted to a settlement.
3. Large Spacecraft
    1. Definition: Mobile units capable of independent travel that can function as settlements or installations,
       carrying population, resources, and production capabilities across the solar system
    2. Key Charactersitcs
        1. Mobility: can traverse space between celestial bodies, follow orbital paths, or travel to specific hexes on a
           surface if capable of atmospheric flight
        2. Populated (Settlement-type): Can carry population (colony ships, generation ships, mobile habitats). Consumes
           air, water, and food, and have similar production/storage to a fixed settlement, but possibly at reduced
           efficiency while moving.
        3. Minimal/no population (installation-type): Can be specialized mobile facility, e.g. Mobile refineries, mining
           ships, military Monitors, factory ships, etc, operated by minimal crew or automated.
        4. Internal systems: have internal buildings or modules (includes engine, life support, cargo bay, refinery
           module, hangar bay, crew quarters, defense systems).
        5. Cargo capacity: Have significant cargo space to transport resources, units, etc.
        6. Formation: can exist individually or as part of a fleet/formation for coordinated movement and combat
        7. Power: requires energy
        8. Vulnerability: Can be more vulnerable to attack from other space units
    9. Locations: Any valid SpaceLocation or SurfaceLocation
    10. Evolution: Can be upgraded
