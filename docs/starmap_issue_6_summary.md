# Issue 6: Mouse Coordinates Display - Quick Summary

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### What Was Implemented

Added a real-time mouse coordinate display panel showing:
1. **Screen Coordinates** - Viewport pixel position (e.g., "Screen: (800, 450)")
2. **Map Coordinates** - World position in light-years (e.g., "Map: (32.50 LY, 18.30 LY)")

### Files Modified

1. **StarMapScreen.tscn**
   - Added `CoordinatesPanel` at position (10, 60)
   - Contains two labels: `ScreenCoordLabel` and `MapCoordLabel`

2. **StarMapPresenter.cs**
   - Added label references and initialization
   - Added `_Process()` method to update coordinates every frame
   - Added `UpdateMouseCoordinates()` method with coordinate transformation logic

### Key Features

âœ… Real-time updates (60 FPS)
âœ… Shows "N/A" when mouse outside viewport
âœ… Accounts for camera pan and zoom
âœ… Proper coordinate transformation: Screen â†’ World â†’ Light-Years
âœ… Clean formatting (whole numbers for screen, 2 decimals for map)

### Coordinate Transformation

```
Mouse Position
    â†“
GetLocalMousePosition() â†’ Screen coordinates (pixels)
    â†“
Apply camera offset and zoom â†’ World coordinates (pixels)
    â†“
Divide by SCALE_FACTOR (5) â†’ Map coordinates (light-years)
```

### Example Output

**At center over Sol:**
```
Screen: (640, 360)
Map: (0.00 LY, 0.00 LY)
```

**Over distant star:**
```
Screen: (920, 215)
Map: (42.40 LY, -14.92 LY)
```

**Mouse outside viewport:**
```
Screen: N/A
Map: N/A
```

### Testing

- [x] Panel appears in correct position
- [x] Coordinates update smoothly as mouse moves
- [x] Works with camera panning
- [x] Works with camera zooming
- [x] Shows N/A when mouse leaves viewport
- [x] No performance issues
- [x] Doesn't interfere with other features
