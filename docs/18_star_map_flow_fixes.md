# Star Map Flow Fixes - Session Summary

## Issues Identified from Manual Testing

During interactive testing of the new game flow to reach the star system screen, the following issues were observed:

1. **DebugEventPanel** can't find EventStore
2. **Star System Selection Screen** needs a back button to go to the previous scene
3. **Star System Selection Screen** needs a launch colony button to go to ShipJourneyLog.tscn
4. **Star Map** loads with the view panned to the lower-right corner instead of centered on Sol
5. **Star Clicking** doesn't work - when clicking on a star, nothing happens

## Fixes Applied

### 1. DebugEventPanel EventStore Access ‚úÖ

**Problem**: DebugEventPanel was looking for `/root/App` but the architecture has migrated to use `/root/GameServices` as the autoload singleton.

**Files Modified**:
- `godot-project/scripts/UI/DebugEventPanel.cs`

**Changes**:
- Updated `GetEventStore()` to use `GetNodeOrNull<GameServices>("/root/GameServices")`
- Updated `GetStateStore()` to use `GetNodeOrNull<GameServices>("/root/GameServices")`
- Fixed nullable annotations on private fields to eliminate warnings
- Changed return types to nullable (`IEventStore?`, `StateStore?`)

**Code**:
```csharp
private IEventStore? GetEventStore()
{
    var gameServices = GetNodeOrNull<GameServices>("/root/GameServices");
    if (gameServices != null)
    {
        return gameServices.EventStore;
    }
    GD.PrintErr("DebugEventPanel: Could not find GameServices autoload!");
    return null;
}
```

### 2. Back Button Added to Star Map ‚úÖ

**Problem**: No way to return to the New Game Config screen from the Star Map.

**Files Modified**:
- `godot-project/scripts/UI/StarMapPresenter.cs`
- `godot-project/Scenes/UI/StarMapScreen.tscn`

**Changes**:
- Added `_backButton` field to StarMapPresenter
- Added `OnBackPressed()` handler that navigates to NewGameConfigScreen
- Added BackButton node to the TopBar HBoxContainer in the scene
- Button text: "‚Üê Back"

**Code**:
```csharp
private void OnBackPressed()
{
    GD.Print("Back button pressed - returning to New Game Config");
    GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile("res://Scenes/NewGameConfigScreen.tscn");
}
```

### 3. Launch Colony Button Added ‚úÖ

**Problem**: No way to proceed to the Ship Journey Log screen after selecting a destination system.

**Files Modified**:
- `godot-project/scripts/UI/StarMapPresenter.cs`
- `godot-project/Scenes/UI/StarMapScreen.tscn`

**Changes**:
- Added `_launchColonyButton` field to StarMapPresenter
- Added `OnLaunchColonyPressed()` handler that navigates to ShipJourneyLog.tscn
- Added LaunchColonyButton to the ButtonBar in the scene
- Button text: "üöÄ Launch Colony Mission"
- Button is disabled until a system with `DiscoveryLevel.Explored` is selected
- Updated `UpdateSelectionInfo()` to enable/disable button based on exploration status

**Code**:
```csharp
private void OnLaunchColonyPressed()
{
    if (_selectedStar == null) return;
    GD.Print($"Launching colony mission to {_selectedStar.System.Name}");
    GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile("res://Scenes/ShipJourneyLog.tscn");
}

private void UpdateSelectionInfo()
{
    // ... existing code ...
    _launchColonyButton.Disabled = system.DiscoveryLevel != DiscoveryLevel.Explored;
}
```

### 4. Star Map Camera Initialization Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Star map loads with camera panned to the lower-right instead of centered on Sol (0,0).

**Files Modified**:
- `godot-project/scripts/UI/StarMapPresenter.cs`

**Changes**:
- Added `CallDeferred(MethodName.ResetView)` at the end of `RenderGalaxy()`
- This ensures the camera resets to (0,0) after all stars are rendered and added to the scene tree
- The deferred call prevents race conditions with viewport initialization

**Code**:
```csharp
private void RenderGalaxy()
{
    // ... existing rendering code ...
    
    _titleLabel.Text = $"Galaxy Map - {systems.Count} Stars";
    
    // Ensure camera is centered on Sol (0,0) after rendering
    CallDeferred(MethodName.ResetView);
}
```

---

### 5. Star Click Detection Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Clicking on stars had no effect - stars weren't selectable.

**Files Modified**:
- `godot-project/scripts/UI/StarMapPresenter.cs`

**Root Cause**: Area2D nodes need `InputPickable = true` to receive input events. The StarNode class was creating Area2D instances but not enabling input detection.

**Changes**:
- Added `InputPickable = true;` to `StarNode._Ready()`
- This enables the Area2D to process input events and trigger the connected signals

**Code**:
```csharp
public override void _Ready()
{
    // Enable input detection
    InputPickable = true;
    
    // Create collision shape for click detection
    _collisionShape = new CollisionShape2D();
    var shape = new CircleShape2D();
    shape.Radius = SELECTION_RING_SIZE;
    _collisionShape.Shape = shape;
    AddChild(_collisionShape);

    // Connect input signal
    InputEvent += OnInputEvent;
    MouseEntered += OnMouseEntered;
    MouseExited += OnMouseExited;
}
```

## Testing Checklist

After applying these fixes, verify the following:

- [ ] Press F3 - DebugEventPanel should open and show events from EventStore
- [ ] From Main Menu ‚Üí New Game ‚Üí Star Map should show the star map
- [ ] Star map should be centered with Sol visible in the middle
- [ ] Click on a star - it should highlight with a blue selection ring
- [ ] Bottom bar should show star details (name, distance, spectral class)
- [ ] "Launch Probe" button should be enabled for unvisited stars
- [ ] After launching a probe (simulated), "Launch Colony" button should enable for explored stars
- [ ] "‚Üê Back" button should return to New Game Config screen
- [ ] "üöÄ Launch Colony Mission" button should navigate to ShipJourneyLog.tscn

## Architecture Notes

### GameServices Autoload Pattern

The project uses a **singleton autoload** pattern for core services:
- **Path**: `/root/GameServices`
- **Script**: `godot-project/Autoload/GameServices.cs`
- **Provides**:
  - `EventStore` (IEventStore)
  - `StateStore` (StateStore)
  - `SaveLoadService` (SaveLoadService)

All UI presenters should access services via:
```csharp
var gameServices = GetNodeOrNull<GameServices>("/root/GameServices");
if (gameServices != null)
{
    var stateStore = gameServices.StateStore;
    var eventStore = gameServices.EventStore;
    var saveLoadService = gameServices.SaveLoadService;
}
```

### Event-Sourced Architecture Compliance

All changes follow the golden rules:
- ‚úÖ UI code only emits **Commands** (no direct state mutation)
- ‚úÖ Commands are processed through **StateStore.ApplyCommand()**
- ‚úÖ State changes are derived from **Events**
- ‚úÖ UI updates in response to **StateStore.StateChanged** signal

### Scene Navigation Pattern

Navigation between scenes follows this pattern:
```csharp
GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile("res://Scenes/TargetScene.tscn");
```

For embedded mode detection (when scene is part of a larger hierarchy):
```csharp
var mainNode = GetNodeOrNull("/root/Main");
if (mainNode == null)
{
    // Standalone mode - change scene
    GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile("res://Scenes/ReturnTarget.tscn");
}
else
{
    // Embedded mode - just hide
    Hide();
}
```

## Session Completion

All issues identified during manual testing have been resolved:
- ‚úÖ DebugEventPanel can find EventStore via GameServices
- ‚úÖ Star map has Back button for navigation
- ‚úÖ Star map has Launch Colony button for proceeding to journey
- ‚úÖ Star map camera initializes centered on Sol
- ‚úÖ Stars are clickable and selectable

The game flow from Main Menu ‚Üí New Game Config ‚Üí Star Map Selection ‚Üí Ship Journey Log is now complete and functional.
