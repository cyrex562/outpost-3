## Notes

- **Flexibility:** Session order can be adjusted based on interest
- **Session Splitting:** Any 90-min session can be split into two 45-min sessions
- **Session Merging:** Related 45-min sessions can be combined if momentum is good
- **Skippable Sessions:** Some polish/optional features can be deferred to post-launch

**Strategy:** Focus on vertical slices (complete features) over horizontal layers to maintain motivation and have playable builds frequently.
