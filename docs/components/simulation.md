# Simulation System

## Overview
The simulation system is the core engine that drives the game's turn-based mechanics and state updates.

## Core Concepts
- Turn-based processing
- State management
- Event handling
- System updates

## Components
- Simulation Manager
- Turn Processor
- State Updater
- Event Queue

## Public API
```rust
// TODO: Document public API
```

## Dependencies
- Game State
- Event System
- Resource System
- Population System

## Implementation Details
- Turn processing order
- State update mechanisms
- Event handling flow

## Future Improvements
- Performance optimization
- Parallel processing
- Advanced event handling
- State persistence
