# Resource System

## Overview
The resource system manages all in-game resources, their production, consumption, and distribution across the game world.

## Core Concepts
- Resource types and categories
- Production chains
- Resource storage and transportation
- Resource consumption
- Resource markets and trade

## Components
- Resource Manager
- Production System
- Storage System
- Transportation System
- Market System

## Public API
```rust
// TODO: Document public API
```

## Dependencies
- Building System
- Population System
- Faction System
- Location System

## Implementation Details
