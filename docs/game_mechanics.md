# Game Mechanics

## Core Gameplay Systems

### Turn-Based Simulation
- Each turn represents a discrete time unit in the game
- All game systems update their state during turn processing
- Events and actions are processed in a deterministic order

### Resource Management
- Resources are produced, consumed, and traded between factions
- Resource production is tied to buildings and population
- Resource transportation and storage systems

### Population and Faction Dynamics
- Population growth and management
- Faction relationships and diplomacy
- Population needs and satisfaction

### Building and Infrastructure
- Construction and maintenance of buildings
- Infrastructure networks
- Production facilities

### Space and Celestial Bodies
- Solar system generation
- Celestial body characteristics
- Resource distribution
