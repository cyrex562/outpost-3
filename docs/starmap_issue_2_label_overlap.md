## ISSUE 2: Star Labels Overlap in Dense Areas ✅ COMPLETE

### Problem Statement
When multiple stars are close together in the galaxy map, their labels overlap and become unreadable, especially when zoomed out.

### Solution Approach

Implemented a **two-pronged strategy**:

1. **Zoom-based Label Visibility** - Hide labels when zoomed out, show them when zoomed in
2. **Smart Label Positioning** - Distribute labels around stars using deterministic hash-based placement

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Zoom-Based Visibility Control

**Concept:**
- Labels only appear when zoom level ≥ 2.0x
- At lower zoom levels, map shows overview with just star dots
- At higher zoom levels, labels provide detail

**Constants Added:**
```csharp
private const float LABEL_VISIBILITY_THRESHOLD = 2.0f; // Only show labels when zoom >= 2.0x
private float _currentZoom = 1.0f; // Track current zoom level
```

**Visibility Logic:**
```csharp
bool shouldShowLabel = System.DiscoveryLevel != DiscoveryLevel.Unknown 
                       && _currentZoom >= LABEL_VISIBILITY_THRESHOLD;
```

**Why 2.0x threshold?**
- At 1.0x zoom: Overview of entire galaxy (100 LY radius)
- At 2.0x zoom: Focusing on specific region (50 LY radius)
- Labels become useful and readable at 2.0x+
- Can be easily adjusted by changing constant

#### 2. Smart Label Positioning

**Problem:** All labels were positioned at lower-right (SE corner)
```csharp
// OLD CODE - always same position
var labelPos = new Vector2(size + 5, size + 5);
```

**Solution:** Distribute labels around stars using system ID hash
```csharp
// NEW CODE - 8 possible positions
var labelPos = GetSmartLabelPosition(size);
```

**Position Distribution:**
```
        N (6)
    NW (5)  NE (7)
        
W (4)  ★  E (0)
        
    SW (3)  SE (1)
        S (2)
```

**Hash-Based Positioning:**
```csharp
private Vector2 GetSmartLabelPosition(float starSize)
{
    // Use system ID hash to deterministically pick a position
    int hash = System.Id.GetHashCode();
    int position = Math.Abs(hash) % 8;
    
    float offset = starSize + 5f;
    
    // 8 positions around the star: E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE
    return position switch
    {
        0 => new Vector2(offset, 0),              // East (right)
        1 => new Vector2(offset, offset),         // Southeast (lower-right)
        2 => new Vector2(0, offset),              // South (below)
        3 => new Vector2(-offset, offset),        // Southwest (lower-left)
        4 => new Vector2(-offset, 0),             // West (left)
        5 => new Vector2(-offset, -offset),       // Northwest (upper-left)
        6 => new Vector2(0, -offset),             // North (above)
        7 => new Vector2(offset, -offset),        // Northeast (upper-right)
        _ => new Vector2(offset, offset)          // Default: Southeast
    };
}
```

**Benefits of Hash-Based Approach:**
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Same star always gets same position
- ✅ **Distributed** - Labels spread evenly across 8 directions
- ✅ **No storage needed** - Calculated on-demand from ID
- ✅ **No performance cost** - Simple hash and modulo operation
- ✅ **Stable** - Position doesn't change with zoom/pan

#### 3. Zoom Level Notification System

**Challenge:** StarNode needs to know current zoom level to show/hide labels

**Solution:** Presenter notifies all stars when zoom changes

**In StarNode:**
```csharp
public void UpdateZoomLevel(float zoomLevel)
{
    if (Mathf.Abs(_currentZoom - zoomLevel) > 0.01f)
    {
        _currentZoom = zoomLevel;
        QueueRedraw(); // Trigger redraw with new zoom level
    }
}
```

**In StarMapPresenter:**
```csharp
private void UpdateStarZoomLevels(float zoomLevel)
{
    foreach (var starNode in _starNodes)
    {
        starNode.UpdateZoomLevel(zoomLevel);
    }
}
```

**Called When:**
1. **On zoom change** (mouse wheel)
   ```csharp
   private void ZoomCamera(float delta, Vector2 mousePosition)
   {
       // ... zoom calculation ...
       UpdateStarZoomLevels(newZoom);
   }
   ```

2. **After rendering galaxy** (initial load)
   ```csharp
   private void RenderGalaxy()
   {
       // ... create stars ...
       UpdateStarZoomLevels(_camera.Zoom.X);
   }
   ```

3. **On reset view** (Space key) - automatically via zoom update

### Visual Behavior

#### At 1.0x Zoom (Default)
```
  ●  ●    ●      ●
    ●  ●     ●
  ●      ●    ●
```
- Only star dots visible
- No labels shown
- Clean overview of galaxy structure
- Easy to see star distribution

#### At 2.0x Zoom (Threshold)
```
  ●─Alpha    ●─Beta
        ●
      Gamma   ●─Delta
  
  ●
Epsilon
```
- Labels start appearing
- Smart positioning reduces overlap
- Stars spread out more (zoom effect)
- Individual systems identifiable

#### At 5.0x+ Zoom (High Detail)
```
        ●
    Proxima
    Centauri
    
                    ●───Alpha Centauri
    
    
    ●
  Sirius
```
- All labels clearly visible
- Large spacing between stars
- Easy to read individual names
- Optimal for navigation

### Label Distribution Statistics

With 100 stars and 8 positions, expected distribution:
- **Each position**: ~12-13 stars (100 / 8 ≈ 12.5)
- **Hash variance**: Should be roughly uniform
- **Overlap reduction**: ~87.5% fewer overlaps vs all SE

**Example with 3 nearby stars:**

**Old behavior (all SE):**
```
  ●─Star A
    └─Star B  ← Overlapping!
      └─Star C  ← Overlapping!
```

**New behavior (distributed):**
```
    Star B
      │
  ●───●   ●
      │   └─Star C
    Star A
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Computational Cost
- **Hash calculation**: O(1) - simple GetHashCode()
- **Modulo operation**: O(1) - single division
- **Position lookup**: O(1) - switch statement
- **Total per star**: Negligible (~nanoseconds)

#### Memory Usage
- **No extra storage** per star (hash computed on-demand)
- **One float added**: `_currentZoom` (4 bytes per StarNode)
- **Total overhead**: ~400 bytes for 100 stars

#### Redraw Frequency
- **On zoom change**: All stars redraw once
- **On pan**: No redraws needed
- **Optimization**: Only redraws if zoom actually changed (> 0.01 difference)

### Edge Cases Handled

#### Very Close Stars
**Before:** Impossible to read any labels
**After:** Labels distributed in different directions, mostly readable

#### Stars at Screen Edge
**Labels may extend off-screen** - This is acceptable because:
- User can pan to see full label
- Alternative would be complex label repositioning logic
- Current solution is simple and predictable

#### Zoom Exactly at Threshold (2.0x)
**Labels appear** - Using `>=` comparison ensures labels visible at exactly 2.0x

#### Rapid Zoom Changes
**Optimization in place:**
```csharp
if (Mathf.Abs(_currentZoom - zoomLevel) > 0.01f)
```
Only redraws if zoom changed by more than 0.01, avoiding redundant redraws

### Comparison with Alternatives

#### Alternative A: Dynamic Label Repositioning
**Pros:** Could eliminate all overlaps
**Cons:** 
- Complex collision detection needed
- Labels would move unpredictably
- Performance cost for 100 stars
- Non-deterministic behavior

#### Alternative B: Show Only Closest N Labels
**Pros:** Always readable
**Cons:**
- Arbitrary selection of which labels to show
- User confusion (why is this star labeled but not that one?)
- Requires sorting/filtering logic

#### Alternative C: Font Size Scaling
**Pros:** Labels visible at all zooms
**Cons:**
- Tiny unreadable text when zoomed out
- Still overlaps when zoomed out
- Doesn't solve core problem

#### **Our Solution (Zoom + Hash Distribution)**
**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple and predictable
- ✅ Performant (O(1) per star)
- ✅ Deterministic (same star = same position)
- ✅ Scales well (works for 100+ stars)
- ✅ User-friendly (labels appear when useful)
- ✅ No complex collision detection
- ✅ Visually clean at all zoom levels

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Labels still overlap for very close stars (even with distribution)
- ⚠️ No labels at low zoom (but this is intentional/desired)

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

#### 1. Adaptive Threshold
```csharp
// Adjust threshold based on star density in view
float threshold = CalculateAdaptiveThreshold(_camera.Position, _camera.Zoom);
```

#### 2. Label Culling
```csharp
// Only draw labels for stars currently in viewport
if (IsStarInViewport(Position, _camera))
    DrawLabel();
```

#### 3. Label Priority System
```csharp
// Show labels for important stars (selected, Sol, etc.) at all zooms
bool alwaysShow = _isSelected || System.Name == "Sol";
if (alwaysShow || _currentZoom >= threshold)
    DrawLabel();
```

#### 4. Collision-Aware Positioning
```csharp
// Check if chosen position would overlap, try next position
int position = FindBestNonOverlappingPosition(starSize);
```

#### 5. Zoom-Based Font Size
```csharp
// Larger font at higher zoom levels
int fontSize = (int)Mathf.Lerp(10, 16, (_currentZoom - 2.0f) / 8.0f);
```

### Configuration

**Easy to adjust threshold:**
```csharp
private const float LABEL_VISIBILITY_THRESHOLD = 2.0f; 
// Change to 1.5f for earlier labels
// Change to 3.0f for later labels
```

**Easy to add more positions:**
```csharp
// Currently 8 positions (% 8)
// Change to 16 positions for finer distribution:
int position = Math.Abs(hash) % 16;
// Add 8 more positions (NNE, ENE, ESE, SSE, SSW, WSW, WNW, NNW)
```
