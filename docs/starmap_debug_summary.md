# Star Map Debug Summary

## Added Debugging Features (2025-10-12)

### ✅ Closest Star Detection
- **Shows closest star on every click** regardless of distance/threshold
- Displays world, map, and screen coordinates
- Shows distance in both world pixels and screen pixels

### ✅ Label Redraw Debugging  
- Logs when `UpdateZoomLevel()` triggers redraws
- Logs when `_Draw()` is called for stars with labels
- Shows actual label positions and inverse zoom scaling

### ✅ Pan Redraw Triggers
- **Fixed:** Panning now triggers star redraws (was missing before)
- Added `TriggerStarRedraws()` method
- Pan movements > 1 pixel trigger redraw of all stars
- Logs pan events and redraw triggers

### ✅ Coordinate Transform Verification
- **Roundtrip testing:** Screen → World → Screen conversion verification
- **Center debugging:** Detailed logging when mouse near screen center
- **Error detection:** Logs if coordinate conversions aren't symmetric

### ✅ Enhanced Zoom Logging
- Shows how many stars are notified of zoom changes
- Logs zoom level transitions

## Key Debug Outputs to Watch

**Click Detection:**
```
StarMapPresenter: Closest star: Alpha Centauri
  World pos: (6.5, 2.3) px | Map pos: (1.3, 0.5) LY | Screen pos: (1350.2, 750.8) px
  Distance from click: 8.2 px (16.4 screen px)
```

**Label Redraws:**
```
StarMapPresenter: UpdateStarZoomLevels to 2.00 - notifying 100 stars
StarNode.UpdateZoomLevel: Sol zoom 1.00 -> 2.00 - triggering redraw
StarNode._Draw: Sol redrawing at zoom 2.00 (should show label)
StarNode._Draw: Sol drawing label at (15.0, 0.0) with inverseZoom 0.50
```

**Pan Events:**
```
StarMapPresenter: Pan - camera moved to (45.2, -23.1)
StarMapPresenter: TriggerStarRedraws - forcing redraw of 100 stars
```

**Coordinate Verification:**
```
DEBUG: Mouse near screen center:
  Screen pos: (1280.0, 800.0) | Camera pos: (0.0, 0.0) | World pos: (0.0, 0.0) | Map pos: (0.0, 0.0) LY
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Load star map** → Check for coordinate debugging at screen center
2. **Click various locations** → Verify closest star info appears
3. **Zoom in/out** → Watch for UpdateZoomLevel and _Draw messages  
4. **Pan around** → Watch for TriggerStarRedraws messages
5. **Look for errors** → Any "ScreenToWorld verification failed!" messages

## Files Modified
- `godot-project/scripts/UI/StarMapPresenter.cs` (~66 lines of debugging added)

The enhanced debugging should reveal exactly where coordinate transformation and font redraw issues are occurring.
